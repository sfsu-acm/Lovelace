# Lovelace
A Discord bot for the [ACM](https://www.acm.org) student chapter at [SFSU](https://www.sfsu.edu). Our bot is lovingly named after [Ada Lovelace](https://findingada.com/about/who-was-ada/), often referred to as "the first computer programmer."

Lovelace is written in TypeScript and built off the [SapphireJS](https://www.sapphirejs.dev) framework and [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) library. She serves to make moderating and running our Discord server a little bit easier.
